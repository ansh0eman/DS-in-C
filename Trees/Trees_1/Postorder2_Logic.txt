The provided code performs an iterative postorder traversal of a binary tree using two stacks. Here's an explanation of the logic:

### Structures and Functions
- `struct Node` represents a node in the binary tree with data, left, and right pointers.
- `struct Stack` is a simple stack structure used for storing tree nodes.
- `createStack` initializes a new stack.
- `isEmpty` checks if the stack is empty.
- `push` adds an element to the stack.
- `pop` removes and returns the top element from the stack.
- `newNode` creates a new node with the given data.

### Iterative Postorder Traversal
1. **Stack Setup**:
   - Two stacks (`stack1` and `stack2`) are created.
   - `stack1` is used to process nodes, while `stack2` is used to reverse the order for postorder traversal.

2. **Traversing and Pushing Nodes**:
   - Begin by pushing the root node onto `stack1`.
   - While `stack1` is not empty, pop nodes from `stack1` and push them onto `stack2`.
   - When pushing onto `stack2`, ensure left child nodes are pushed first to reverse the order.
   - This process is done until all nodes are processed.

3. **Printing in Postorder**:
   - Once all nodes are pushed onto `stack2`, start popping from `stack2`.
   - Popping from `stack2` yields the nodes in postorder, allowing the printing of node values.

4. **Explanation**:
   - The postorder sequence is left-right-root, so by pushing nodes in the order of root-right-left (onto `stack2`), they can be printed in the correct postorder sequence when popping from `stack2`.

This two-stack approach effectively reverses the order of traversal to achieve the postorder sequence without the use of recursion. It processes the nodes in a manner that facilitates the printing of nodes in the postorder sequence once the traversal is completed.
