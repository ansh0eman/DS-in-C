The provided code is an implementation of a search function in a binary tree using a preorder traversal approach. It searches for a specific element (`ele`) within the binary tree. It maintains a static variable `t` to keep track of the number of occurrences of the element found during the traversal. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

### Function Parameters:
- `Nodeptr root`: The root node of the binary tree.
- `int ele`: The element to search for in the tree.

### Preorder Search Logic:
1. **Static Variable `t`**:
    - `t` is initialized as a static variable outside the scope of the function to keep track of the number of occurrences of the element `ele` found during traversal.

2. **Base Case and Preorder Traversal**:
    - The function performs a recursive preorder traversal of the tree.
    - The search begins at the root of the tree and checks if the current node contains the element to be searched (`ele`).
    - If the current node contains the element, `t` is incremented, indicating that the element is found.
    - If not, the search continues recursively for both the left and right subtrees (if they exist) until the element is found or the entire tree is traversed.

3. **Returning the Count of Occurrences**:
    - The function returns the count of occurrences of the element `ele` found during the traversal.
    - If the element is not found, it returns 0.
