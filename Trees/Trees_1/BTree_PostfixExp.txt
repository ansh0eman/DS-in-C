To create a binary tree from a postfix expression, you can use a stack to build the tree. 
The postfix expression is scanned from left to right, and based on the operands and operators encountered, 
a binary tree is constructed.

Explanation:

1. The buildExpressionTree function builds a binary tree from a postfix expression.

2. It iterates through the postfix expression character by character.

3. If an operand is encountered, it creates a node and pushes it onto the stack.

4. If an operator is encountered, it pops two nodes from the stack (representing the operands), 
constructs a node for the operator, and sets the popped nodes as its left and right children.

5. After scanning the entire postfix expression, the final root of the tree is returned from the stack.

6. The inorder function performs an inorder traversal to print the infix expression obtained from the 
constructed tree.

7. This code builds a binary tree from a given postfix expression and then prints the corresponding 
infix expression using an inorder traversal of the tree.
